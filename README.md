# OBJECTIVE

fillet the selected vertex of a profile by dragging the mouse inwards
max fillet radius is reached @ the shortest delta of surrounding verts

# [x] MILESTONE 1 
[x] get selected vertex index. 
[x] get indices of attached verts.
[x] get their lengths, return shortest.
[x] shortest length is max fillet radius.

# [x] MILESTONE 2
[x] draw gl bevel line from both edges (bev_edge1, bev_edge2)
[x] find center of bevel line
[x] draw centre guide line.
[x] call new found point 'fillet_centre"
[x] calculate verts 'KAPPA'
[x] calculate verts 'TRIG'

# [ ] MILESTONE 3
[x] draw faux vertices
[x] draw opengl filleted line.
[x] allow view rotate, zoom
[x] allow ctrl+numpad +/- to define segment numbers.
[x] esc/rclick to cancel.
[x] sliders update in realtime
[ ] make shift+rightlick, draw manipulation line to mouse cursor.
[ ] enter to accept, and make real.
[ ] make faces [ tri, quad ]
[ ] user must apply all transforms, or matrix * vector
